    "Here we define the partial trace and show how <u>easy</u> and <u>efficient</u> it is to perform this operation using tensor network representations and by employing the simple tricks and knowledge we have introduced in [Lecture 1](lecture1.md) and [Lecture 2](lecture2.md). \n",
    "\n",
    "The most direct advantage of using the tensor network representation in computing the partial trace is that we avoid building the the total density matrix and only output the final reduced density matrix! \n",

    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "Partial trace operation holds an important role in quantum information. Partial trace is an 'inverse' operation of the tensor product. Tensor product forms larger composity systems from smaller ones, while partial trace forms smaller systems by ignoring degree's of freedom of the larger system. Partial trace is directly related to [marginal probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution).\n",
