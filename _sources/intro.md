# Introduction to Tensor Networks! 

Welcome! In these notes, we will give a brief and efficient exposition of Tensor Network methods used in the fields such as Quantum Many-body Physics and Quantum Information. The emphasis is given on practical examples that involve creating, manipulating and in general using tensors in the programming language Python.

Our goal is to understand and use the following Tensor Network:
