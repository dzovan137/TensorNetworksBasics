# Introduction to Tensor Networks 

Welcome! In these notes, we will give a brief and efficient exposition of Tensor Network (TN) methods used in the fields such as Quantum Many-body Physics and Quantum Information. The emphasis is given on practical examples that involve creating, manipulating and in general using tensors in the programming language Python.

Tensor Networks are extremely important in the following fields

- Quantum Many-Body Physics
- Quantum Information
- Neural Networks and Machine Learning
 



Our <u>tentative goal</u> here is to understand and use the following example of a Tensor Network (TN)

and after this short course you will be able to build and use such networks yourself! :)
